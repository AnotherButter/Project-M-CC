# Project-M-Dev-Build-Completion
This is a repository dedicated to compiling all fixes made to the leaked builds of Project M into version 3.6.

Currently it has combined the cosmetics of the Halloween Update with 3.6. It has also added with Knuckles, Lyn, and Isaac from the "Development Build", along with additional cosmetic fixes for Knuckles and Lyn and fixes to prevent Lyn from crashing when using her alts.

This build works on Wii and Dolphin.

Mission Statement: This build is intended to finish the work of the PMDT's development build and get a final, unofficial build. In order to preserve the 3.6 meta, there are no rebalances to characters that are already in place, except for bug fixes. To that end, this build is based off of 3.6. At the very least all the bugs should be fixed and Knuckles and Lyn will be finished.

What This Build is NOT: This build is not meant to be the "tournament standard". It is simply a group of modders coming together with the common goal of finishing Project M the way it was intended to be. This build is neither a place to add tons of new characters nor rebalance the entire game. Perhaps in the future Isaac can be completed, but as of right now, it's much more important to focus on what finishing what is almost done!

Installation:

1. Copy the "projectm" folder to the root of your SD card.
2. Copy the "codes" folder to wherever your codes folder is.
3. Copy "gameconfig.txt" to the root of your SD card.
4. Confirm any file overwrites.

You're done!

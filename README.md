# Project-M-Dev-Build-Completion
This is a repository dedicated to fixing the issues in the leaked devolpment build of Project M 3.6.

Mission Statement: This build is intented to finish the work of the Project M team's development build, and to get a final, unofficial 4.0 build. In order to preserve the current meta, there should be little to no rebalances to characters that are already in place. This build at the very least, should fix all the bugs and finish Knuckles and Lyndis.

What This Build is NOT: This build is not meant to be the "tournament standard". It is simply a group of modders coming together to complete the common goal of finishing Project M the way it was intended to be. This build is not a place to add tons of new characters, nor rebalance the entire game. Perhaps in the future Sami can be completed, but as of right now, it's much more important to focus on what finishing up on what is almost done than focusing on anything new!

Installation: 
1) Copy and paste the "projectm" folder in this download onto the root of your SD card

3) Copy "gameconfig.txt" to the root of your SD card
4) Say "Yes" to any overwrites 
You're done!

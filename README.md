# Project-M-Dev-Build-Completion
This is a repository dedicated to compiling all fixes made to the leaked builds of Project M.

Currently it has combined the "Halloween Update" with Knuckles, Lyn, and Isaac from the "Development Build", cosmetic fixes for Knuckles and Lyn, and with fixes to prevent Lyn from crashing with using her alts. 

This build works on Wiis and Dolphin.

Mission Statement: This build is intented to finish the work of the Project M team's development build, and to get a final, unofficial 3.7 build. In order to preserve the current meta, there should be no rebalances to characters that are already in place. This build at the very least, should fix all the bugs and finish Knuckles and Lyndis.

What This Build is NOT: This build is not meant to be the "tournament standard". It is simply a group of modders coming together with the common goal of finishing Project M the way it was intended to be. This build is not a place to add tons of new characters, nor rebalance the entire game. Perhaps in the future Isaac can be completed, but as of right now, it's much more important to focus on what finishing up on what is almost done than focusing on anything new!

3) Copy "gameconfig.txt" to the root of your SD card

You're done!
